# 🌍 Earthquake Data Visualization in Indonesia

This project aims to provide an interactive visualization of earthquake data in Indonesia using HTML, JavaScript, and libraries such as Leaflet and Chart.js. With this approach, users can understand the spatial and temporal distribution of seismic activity in earthquake-prone regions.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Interactive Map**: Displays the location of earthquakes in Indonesia using Leaflet.
- **Histogram**: Visualizes the frequency distribution of earthquakes based on magnitude.
- **Time Series Graph**: Shows the trend of earthquake occurrences over time.

## 📦 Directory Structure

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection to load external libraries and geoJSON data

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marqynew/Visualisasi-Data-Gempa-Bumi-Indonesia.git
   cd Visualisasi-Data-Gempa-Bumi-Indonesia
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the interactive map.

3. Access linechart.html to see the earthquake occurrence trend over time.

4. View histogram.html to see the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

## 📊 Data
The earthquake data is sourced from reliable providers and stored in CSV format. The indonesia-province.json file contains GeoJSON data for the interactive map.
